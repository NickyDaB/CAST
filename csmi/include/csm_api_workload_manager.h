/** 
 * @ingroup wm_apis
 * @brief Used by the workload manager to allocate nodes for a job.
 *
 * This API performs actions on the Master and Compute Daemons.
 *
 * The allocation requires at least a job id and a list of nodes in the @p allocation struct.
 *
 * ## Master Daemon ##
 *
 * ### Critical Path ###
 * The Master Daemon is expected to do the following steps (in order):
 *  -# Insert a record for the API into the *csm_allocation* table.
 *  -# Insert the nodes into the *csm_node* table (failing if the node is not available).
 *  -# Issue a multicast to the Compute Agents specified.
 *  -# Record the starting resource usage of the Compute Agents.
 *
 * ### Failure Path ###
 * In the event that any of the nodes fail to create the allocation the following will happen:
 *  -# Revert the changes to the database and write the failure to *csm_allocation_history*.
 *  -# Execute a multicast to undo any changes on the local nodes.
 *
 * ## Compute Daemon ##
 *
 * ### Critical Path ##
 * A successful API will perform the following steps on the Compute Agents (in order):
 *  -# Log that the allocation is beginning (for BDS analytics).
 *  -# Collect the initial node resource usage.
 *  -# Create a cgroups on the compute nodes specified (if flagged).
 *  -# Register the allocation with the compute daemon.
 *  -# Export the `allocation_id`, `primary_job_id`, `secondary_job_id` and `user_name`.
 *  -# Execute the prolog (using user and system flags supplied).
 *  -# Collect any data that the user could change in the prolog (psr, power cap).
 *
 * ### Failure Path ###
 * If **ANY** nodes fail to complete the above the following is performed on the remaining nodes:
 *  -# Log that the allocation is concluding (for BDS analytics).
 *  -# Clear the cgroups.
 *  -# Execute the epilog.
 *
 * Changes to @p allocation 
 * ------------------------
 * When an allocation create is executed the following fields are populated in @p allocation:
 *          Field | Description
 *     -----------|-------------
 *  allocation_id | CSM assigned value
 *
 *
 *  ## Database Tables ##
 *                Table | Description 
 * ---------------------|--------------------------------
 *       csm_allocation | Tracks the overall allocation. 
 *  csm_allocation_node | tracks the allocation on a node.
 *
 * @since Beta 2.2 Added CGroup core isolation, control logic now the same as delete and update.
 *
 * @param[out] handle     An output pointer containing internally managed api data, destroy with 
 *                          @ref csm_api_object_destroy.
 * @param[in]  input      Specifies the parameters of the allocation being created, 
 *                          the `allocation_id` field is populated with the new allocation id
 *                          when successfully created.
 *
 * @note The error message may be retrieved though use of @ref csm_api_object_errmsg_get with
 *          @p handle.
 *
 * @returns An error code from the table below.
 *

/** @ingroup wm_apis
 *  @brief Used by the workload manager to delete an existing allocation.
 * 
 * This API performs actions on the Master and Compute Daemons.
 *
 * ## Master Daemon ##
 *
 *  ### Critical Path ###
 *  The Master Daemon will perform the following steps in the event of a successful delete:
 *   -# Verify the supplied allocation id is that of an active job.
 *   -# Perform a multicast to clean up the nodes participating in the allocation.
 *   -# Aggregate the resource usage and add it to the allocation history.
 *   -# Remove the active allocation from the *csm_allocation* and *csm_allocation_node* tables.
 *
 *  ### Failure Path ###
 *  In the event of a failure the Master Daemon will attempt the following:
 *   -# Flag any nodes that could not be accessed (if it failed in the multicast).
 *   -# Remove the allocation from the active table and free any "good nodes" for later.
 *
 * ## Compute Daemon ##
 *
 *  ### Critical Path ##
 *  The Compute Agent Daemon will execute the following locally in order:
 *   -# Log that the allocation is concluding (for BDS analytics).
 *   -# Export the `allocation_id`, `primary_job_id`, `secondary_job_id` and `user_name`.
 *   -# Execute the epilog using the user and system flags stored in the database.
 *   -# Deregister the allocation with the compute daemon.
 *   -# Remove the cgroups for the allocation being deleted.
 *   -# Aggregate the node resources for processing and computation.
 *
 *  ### Failure Path ###
 *  If the multicast fails the API Handler does not return to the Compute Agent.
 *
 *  ## Database Tables ##

 * @brief Stops an active step, removing it from the CSM Database and performing any necessary operations on the Nodes.

 * ## Master Daemon ##
 *
 * ### Critical Path ###
 * The Master Daemon is expected to perform the following steps (in order):
 *      -# Remove the records of the step from the *csm_step* and *csm_step_node* tables. This
 *          process will save the records from *csm_step* to *csm_step_history*
 *  @todo Should this move the *step_node* to *csm_step_node_history*?
 *
 * ### Failure Path ###
 * In the event of a failure the Master Daemon will attempt to do the following:
 *      -# Exit the execution returning an illustrative error.
 *
 * ## Compute Daemon ##
 * 
 * ### Critical Path ###
 * The Compute Daemon is expected to perform the following steps (in order):
 *      -# Export the `allocation_id` to the environment.
 *      -# Execute the epilog as a step epilog.
 *
 * ### Failure Path ###
